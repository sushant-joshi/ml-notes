# Notes on ML

## Types of Data

```
### Structured
 - Categorical
 - Numerical
 - Ordinal
 - Time Series

### Unstructured
 - Images, Speech, etc
```

## Types of Models
```
1. Classification Model - When you need to predict what class or category a data point (dependant variable) belongs to based on given sets of input(s) (independent variable). Classification models could be divided into Binary, Multi-Class or Multi-Label classification problems.

2. Regression Model - When you need to predict a numerical value (dependant variable) belongs to based on a given set of input(s) (independent variable).
```

## Types of ML Algorithms

Broadly classified into Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms.

```
### Supervised Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- AdaBoost / Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Algorithms
- Clustering
- Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction
- Anamoly Detection
```

### Evaluation Metrics 
```
- Classification 
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - f1 score
  
- Regression
  - r-squared
  - MSE - Mean Squared Error
  - MAE - Mean Absolute Error

```
