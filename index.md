## Notes on ML


### Types of ML Algorithms

Broadly classified into Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms.

# Supervised Algorithms

## Linear Regression
Draw a line that best fits data scattered on a graph. Produces continuous variables.

## Logistic Regression
Predicts a binary outcome based on a series of independent variables. For example, if you are trying to predict whether someone has a heart disease or not based on their health parameters.

## k-Nearest Neighbours
Find k examples which are most similar to each other. Then, given a new sample, which is the new sample most closely aligned with ?

## Support Vector Machines
Can be used for classification or regression. Try to find the best way to separate data points using multiple planes (referred to as Hyperplanes)

## Decision Trees and Random Forests
Can be used for classification and regression () 

## AdaBoost / Gradient Boosting
## Neural Networks

# Unsupervised Algorithms
- Clustering
- Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction
- Anamoly Detection
